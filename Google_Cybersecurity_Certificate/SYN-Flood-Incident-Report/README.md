# SYN Flood Attack Incident Report

This case study analyzes a network outage at a travel agency where employees experienced 
connection timeouts while accessing the sales webpage. Packet captures revealed a large 
volume of TCP SYN packets from an unfamiliar IP address, overwhelming the server’s ability 
to complete TCP handshakes. The behavior matched a SYN flood attack, a form of DoS attack 
designed to exhaust server resources.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- TCP handshake analysis
- Identifying SYN flood patterns
- Understanding DoS attack behavior
- Documenting incident impact and response actions

## Tools / Concepts Used
- Packet capture analysis
- TCP flags (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK, RST)
- Firewall blocking and server recovery procedures
