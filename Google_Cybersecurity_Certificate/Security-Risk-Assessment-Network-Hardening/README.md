# Security Risk Assessment: Network Hardening

This case study evaluates an organization’s network security posture and identifies four major 
vulnerabilities: password sharing, default administrative credentials, missing firewall rules, and 
the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA). The report recommends three key hardening 
methods—strong password policies, firewall maintenance, and MFA—to reduce risk and improve 
overall security resilience.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Security risk assessment
